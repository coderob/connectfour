# Connect Four

Connect Four game with the following characteristics:

Technologies Used:
- Angular 2.0
- TypeScript
- Bootstrap
- Node and NPM

If I had more time I would...
- Add AI to block opponent wins.
- Finish the Min/Max tree for the AI to consume.
- Wire up external Angular component templates and stylesheets.
- Switch CSS to LESS.
- Finish the functionality for the Min/Max game tree.
- Add controls in the UI to change board dimensions and connection requirement. *Want a 78x62 grid to play Connect 47?* **LET'S DO IT!** *(ok not really)*.
- Add some automated unit tests and E2E tests.
